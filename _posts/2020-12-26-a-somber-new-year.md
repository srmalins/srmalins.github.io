It's the day after Christmas and just about a week until the new
year. I won't say it's been a great year, but there have been very
happy and fulfilling moments in it. And I did get almost everything I
wanted for Christmas; and that is more than too many people can
say. As I was relaxing and doomscrolling twitter last night, I came
across a plea by someone I follow on twitter dot com. 

**Mari** needs help to repay money that she thought was hers, but that
the government thinks it gave her by mistake. Obviously, one should be
careful when considering donating to people online. I've not
personally met Mari, but I have followed her long enough to know that
her plight is not a ruse or trick of someone *beating the system* or a
common scam. You can read what happened, in her own words, here: 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-partner="tweetdeck"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">a 20 tweet thread on the reason I&#39;m rationing meds (and medical treatments.) With federal debts there is no guarantee my child won’t be stuck with these debts when I die. (whilst im not planning on dying? skipping med doses &amp; visits, + lawyer ≠ affordable) <a href="https://t.co/MLiZpwiLf7">https://t.co/MLiZpwiLf7</a></p>&mdash; Mari | gofundme.com/erasing-the-number (@wordglass) <a href="https://twitter.com/wordglass/status/1342613844955332608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 25, 2020</a></blockquote>

Because I have dealt with SSDI because my wife is on it, I know how
wild and unfair their decisions can be. I retweeted the above with the
simple plea: "HELP!" But the internet, and Mari, would not let me off
so easily. 

> why should anyone help her though? No reason....why do you think she
> should be helped?

Mari quickly, and somewhat appropriately, responded. As the cracks
grow in our society, exposing faults that most of us find unpleasant
at best, it seems that there are more cries for help than one can
practically answer. I will admit that initially I was ever so slightly
nonplussed by Mari's response. But I responded with a few reasons to
my literally hundreds of twitter followers why one ought to help
Mari. 

I maintain that helping fellow beings should be an *intrinsic
motivation*; that it should be done for it's own reward and
cause. That for those whom it is not, I do not posses sufficient
understanding of their thought processes to attempt to persuade
them. If you can help Mari by donating $4 or (inclusive or) sharing
her post, you should do so *because it is the right thing to do!* 

But alas, some might need just a gentle nudge to help Mari in
particular. Mari is a very kind, generous, and loving soul. What is
being done to her, the government mandating repayment of disability
payments, is an injustice that you can help correct. So here are 5
reasons you should help Mari:

1. Because you forgot to get me a Christmas present. Look, it's been a
   wild year. If you donate to Mari's gofundme (link in the tweet, or
   at the bottom of this post) or share this post I will consider it
   in lieu of a personal gift to me.
2. Mari's mother, who lives with her and who she cares for, is an
   indigenous elder. Your help will also help Mari's mother. I am not
   sure if colonizers can understand the value of elders of a people
   who have lived on their land for thousands of years; but you can
   help one right now, today, for just $4. 
3. Mari is an artist and author; helping them helps increase the
   amount of art in the world. Now art is not building roads; but no
   one can argue that the world is perfect. When the imperfections of
   the world assail our senses and it seems like we cannot go on, often
   art is the only thing that sustains us and makes the world
   bearable. Supporting artists should be a staple of a just and
   enlightened society; plus you can call yourself a *patron of the
   arts*! 
4. Mutual aid is the only way any of us are going to get through
   this. I won't sugar coat it; things are bad for a lot of people,
   not just Mari. It's not right. It's not fair. And none of us can
   stop all, or even most, or even a significant portion, of the
   injustices that surround us. But we can help each other. We can
   start where we are, with what we have, and do what we are able. In
   the end, there is no justice; there is just us. 
5. Mari would do the same for you. I have followed her long enough to
   know that. She absolutely would do the same for you, a stranger on
   the internet. That's gotta be worth something, right? You have my
   personal guarantee that Mari would do the same for you.
