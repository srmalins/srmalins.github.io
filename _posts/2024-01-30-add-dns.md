So you want to add a DNS record, huh? 

For a very basic premier on what DNS is see here [DNS Crash Course](https://srmalins.github.io/2020/02/27/dns.html)

But lets say you need to add a DNS record, for example to verify email. For this example, I am going to assume you are using Mailchimp and you want to authenticate your domain to send email from it. Mailchimp helpfully says

> We recommend referring to your providerâ€™s documentation or support for specific information on adding CNAME records.

Helpful if it exists, but what if you don't even know where to start? Most hosting providers provide an interface to DNS through CPanel, so that is what I will be using.

I will provide screenshots using one of my domains 'twilighteve.com' 

Mailchimp says

> Next to your domain, click View DKIM settings. A modal will appear with instructions for setting up DKIM on your DNS provider. Add two new CNAME records with the name *mte1._domainkey.example.com* and *mte2._domainkey.exaxmple.com* (replace example.com with the domain you're setting up)

>The value for the record should first CNAME should be *dkim1.mandrillapp.com*, and the value for the second record should be *dkim2.mandrillapp.com*.

How do we do that? Well log in to your hosting/domain name provider and you should see something like this
