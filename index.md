Hello world! My name is Steve and I am a freelance writer and code
slinger, you can hire me for your projects at very (some have said)
reasonable rates.

## Where Are You?

Are you in the correct place? 

- If you are looking for acupuncture and primary care services, you
  might try [TopazMessenger.com](https://topazmessenger.com)
- If you are looking for personal essays and more random thoughts,
  there is always [Twilighteve.com](https://twilighteve.com) 
- Interested in privacy and encryption?
  [KeyBase.io](https://keybase.io/stevemal) 
  
## Rates? 

Do you hate going to a site and looking for a price and being told to
*contact us for a quote* or *email us to see how we can save you
money*? None of that here, if you want me to work for you here's what
it will set you back*

- **Writing**: 5 cents ($0.05) per word; or $75 for aproximately 2,000
  article. Includes research and links if neccesary. Open to negotiate
  rates for longer peices / longer term contracts. 
- **Web Design / Coding**: $50/hour. There is a 2 hour minimum for
  most projects, and a website usually takes about 8 hours of work to
  get from idea to finished product. 
- **Consulting or Long Term Projects** Varies with the project,
  unfortunately. Let me know what you want and I'll let you know if I
  can do it and how much it will cost to have me do it. 
  
*Not a complete list of services. Each engagement will come with a
scope of work document that specifies deliverables and final cost. 

## Why Me? 

I have a Master's degree in Acupuncture and Oriental
Medicine. including 450 graduate hours in biomedicine and 5 years of
clinical experience in primary care and public health. Need someone to
cut through the jib/jab on holistic health who also has two thumbs? 

/me points thumbs at self

I have a minor in computer science and have written over 5000 lines
(aproximation) of both Java and Lisp. I am, as the kids say, *very
online*, and have been since that meant using mIRC and later ICQ. Need
a common sense take on tech, the internet of things, or things on the
internet? Email me. (Yes, I'm aware of the irony in that statement
given the preceding paragraph).
